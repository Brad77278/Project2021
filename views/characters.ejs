                    he can usually be found charging into battle with his trusty blade at his side ready to save his
                    comrades yet again. There truly is nothing that can stop him.

                <p>The "goody two-shoes" of the party. Suniva is our ever righteous cleric and healer. She is as brave as she is holy.
                    Sometimes called the "diplomat", Suniva often prefers to use her words before her sword. But don't let her calm 
                    demeanor fool you. She is one of the strongest fighers in the party.

                    There is no task too hard and no fact too obscure for Thea. Accompanied by her trusty panther Samba, Thea is always 
                    in the thick of it.

                    ready to dive in.

                    Larissa is often at the front of the party when it comes to all matters. When it comes down to it, the party can always count on Larissa, though
                    I wouldn't leave your gold unattended around her.
