Personal site for my Dungeons and Dragons party, Team Victory.

The site was built to showcase our party members and give a background on the campaign.
I wanted to build a site that the party could use to reference past events and I hope to add some blog functionality to it in the future.
The front-end is built using EJS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. On the back-end I used Node.js with a connection to a SQL database.
The user can view past events including the date and a basic overview of what happened. New events can also be created and are saved to a SQL database.

This is version 1 of the site, I am actively working on upgrading and adding functionality, including adding React.js components.
